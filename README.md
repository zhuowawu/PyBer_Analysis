## Overview
In this project, the data provided was analyzed for fare by date among 3 different city types. In this analysis, the matplotlib feature was utilized with JupyterNotebook, and a line chart wa delivered as a result of the analysis

## Results

As shown in the picture, urban area fares were the highest among all 3 city type during the time window. The rural area fares are the lowest compared to the other two. Urban area and Suburban area have the highest fares around the begeinning of March, while rural area gets the highest fares entering April.

However, from our data analysis, we could see that though urban areas have the highest total earnings, each individual ride and driver in rural areas got much higher fare than urban and suburban rides and drivers.

## Summary
From our analysis, we could see that the amount of drivers in rural area is much smaller than the amount of drivers in urban and suburban areas, resulting in much high fare for each ride and driver. A recommendation is to relocate some drivers from urban areas to rural areas, or to simply increase the amount of rural drivers to lower the cost of PyBer, which could encourage more rides and an overall higher profit for the company.
